An introduction to continued fractions
======================================

Mathematics begins with counting from one:

.. math:: 1, 2, 3, \dots
   
An extremely important number is :math:`0` (zero). We add this to the above set of numbers and call these the natural numbers and denote them by :math:`\NN`. The next step is to introduce fractions such as

.. math::

   \frac{1}{2}, \frac{4}{5}, \frac{17}{12}, \dots

Remarkably there are numbers that are not fractions! The square root of :math:`2` is a positive number :math:`x` with
:math:`x^2 = x\cdot x = 2`. There is an extraordinarily beautiful argument that such a number cannot be a fraction! Take a look:


.. attention::

   Suppose that

   .. math:: x = \frac{p}{q},
      :label: broek     
	     
   where :math:`p` and :math:`q` are natural numbers and :math:`x^2 = 2`. Of course, here we have to require that :math:`q \neq 0`. We can also assume that :eq:`broek` is reduced to lowest terms i.e., there is no natural number
   :math:`n>1` dividing both :math:`p` and :math:`q`.

   Then we  multiply both sides of :eq:`broek` by :math:`q` to get

   .. math:: p = q x
      :label: ident
	     
   and therefore

   .. math:: p^2 = (q x)^2 = (q x)\cdot (q x) = q^2 x^2 = 2 q^2
      :label: qins
	      
   by squaring both sides of :eq:`ident` and using the assumption that :math:`x^2 = 2`. A useful result is that if the square of a number is even, then the number itself is even! You can immediately spot from :eq:`qins` that :math:`p^2` is an even number (since :math:`2` divides it).  
      
   This implies that :math:`2` divides :math:`p` and we may write :math:`p = 2 m` for some :math:`m\in \mathbb{N}`. Now insert this into :eq:`qins` to get

   .. math:: (2 m)^2 = 4 m^2 = 2 q^2

   Now conclude that :math:`q^2 = 2 m^2` and therefore, in the same way as for :math:`p^2`, that :math:`q` is even, since :math:`q^2` is even. So our assumption that :math:`x` is a fraction :math:`p/q` leads us to conlude that :math:`2` divides both :math:`p` and :math:`q`. This is a contradiction, since we have assumed that :math:`p/q` is reduced to lowest terms.

Today such a proof seems natural, but thousands of years ago it stunned humanity. History seems to show that human casualties were involved: the Pythagorean philosopher `Hippasus of Metapontum <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippasus>`_ is supposed to have drowned at sea as a punishment from the gods for discovering such numbers.

.. note:: 

 .. eqt:: contfrac1

    What is :math:`\sqrt{2}` rounded to :math:`6` decimal places?

    A) :eqt:`I` :math:`1.414213`

    #) :eqt:`C` :math:`1.414214`

    #) :eqt:`I` :math:`1.421324`

    #) :eqt:`I` None of the above





Decimal expansion of rational numbers
-------------------------------------

.. role:: red

How do we compute the decimal expansion of a fraction? The decimal
expansion of :math:`1/3` is 0.333... while the decimal expansion of
:math:`1/7` is 0.142857 :red:`142857` 142857 ... 
There seems to be a pattern of periodicity - a sequence of digits that
repeats itself. This is in fact characteristic of the decimal
expansion of a rational number. Why is this? Let us have a closer look at the
divison algorithm for computing the decimal expansion of :math:`1/7`:

.. math::

   \begin{align*}
   \frac{10}{7} &= 1 + \frac{3}{7}\\
   \frac{30}{7} &= 4 + \frac{2}{7}\\
   \frac{20}{7} &= 2 + \frac{6}{7}\\
   \frac{60}{7} &= 8 + \frac{4}{7}\\
   \frac{40}{7} &= 5 + \frac{5}{7}\\
   \frac{50}{7} &= 7 + \frac{1}{7}\\
   \frac{10}{7} &= 1 + \frac{3}{7}\\
                &\vdots
   \end{align*}

You see that the decimal expansion repeats once we encounter a left
hand side that we have encountered before - in this case :math:`10/7`. This has something to do with remainders modulo :math:`7` of
which there are only :math:`0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6`. There are only a finite set of possibilities. Sooner or later you are bound to encounter a left hand side you have seen before. This happens when you compute the decimal expansion of any rational number :math:`p/q`.

.. important::

   Here is a fun problem. If :math:`p` is a prime number, can you say something about the length of the period of the decimal expansion of :math:`1/p`? We just saw above that the length of the period in the decimal expansion of  :math:`1/7` is :math:`6`. However, for the prime number :math:`11` the length of the period in the decimal expansion is only :math:`2`, since well, :math:`1/11 = 0.090909\dots`. How do we predict the length of the period for a general prime number?

.. note:: 

 .. eqt:: contfrac2

    What is the period length in the decimal expansion of :math:`1/31`?

    A) :eqt:`I` :math:`5`

    #) :eqt:`I` :math:`13`

    #) :eqt:`C` :math:`15`

    #) :eqt:`I` :math:`10`


The beauty and general principles of mathematics tells us that the
answer :math:`13` in the above mcq simply has to be false. This is another story. Maybe later!
In the mean time you may want to experiment a bit with `Sage <http://sagemath.org>`_:

.. admonition:: Computational experiment

   .. sage::
      
      numerical_approx(1/31, digits=30)



A periodic decimal expansion is a fraction
------------------------------------------

.. attention::
   Consider a periodic decimal expansion

   .. math::

         z.x_1x_2\dots x_my_1y_2\dots y_ny_1 y_2\dots y_n\dots,

   where :math:`z` is an integer and

   .. math::

      x_i, y_j\in \{0, 1, \dots, 9\}.

   Let me give a proof that such a number
   is in fact rational. It is enough to prove that the number

   .. math::

     r = 0.y_1y_2\dots y_ny_1 y_2\dots y_n\dots,

   is rational. For this purpose we let :math:`w` denote the number
   :math:`y_1y_2\dots y_n` written in base :math:`10`. Then

   .. math::

     \begin{align*}
     r &= w 10^{-n} + w 10^{-2n} + \cdots = w 10^{-n} (1 + 10^{-n} + 10^{-2n} + \cdots)\\
       &= w 10^{-n} \frac{1}{1 - 10^{-n}}\\
       &= \frac{w}{10^n - 1}
     \end{align*}

Let us do a reality check on the above proof. Consider our old friend

.. math::
   1/7 = 0.142857142857142857\dots

According to the above proof this periodic decimal expansion is the number

.. math::

   \frac{142857}{10^6-1} = \frac{142857}{999999}

You can check this fraction equals :math:`\frac{1}{7}` in the WolframAlpha window above.


An algorithm for expanding any real number into a fraction!
-----------------------------------------------------------

Philosophically we do not know what a number is, but are in some sense
forced to accept :math:`\sqrt{2}` as a genuine number. After all, it
is by the Pythegorean theorem the length of the hypotenuse in a simple
right triangle!

Let us assume that we know what a number is and denote the set
of numbers with :math:`\mathbb{R}` . Now take any number
:math:`\xi\in \mathbb{R}` and let :math:`\lfloor \xi \rfloor` denote
the largest integer :math:`\leq \xi` i.e.,

.. math::

   \lfloor \xi \rfloor \leq \xi < \lfloor \xi \rfloor + 1

If :math:`\lfloor \xi \rfloor < \xi`, then

.. math:: \xi = \lfloor \xi \rfloor + \xi - \lfloor \xi \rfloor =
   \lfloor \xi \rfloor + \frac{1}{\cfrac{1}{\xi - \lfloor \xi \rfloor}} =
   \lfloor \xi \rfloor + \frac{1}{\xi_1}
   :label: algcf
   
Now we can play the same game with the number :math:`\xi_1` unless
:math:`\lfloor \xi_1 \rfloor = \xi_1` and the game stops!


Let us play the game with a decimal approximation to :math:`\sqrt{2}`, say
:math:`\xi = 1.414214`. The first step of the game is

.. math:: 1.414214 = 1 + 0.414214 = 1 + \frac{1}{\cfrac{1}{0.414214}} = 1 + \frac{1}{2.144211}
	  :label: game

  
   
The game continues


.. math::

   2.414214 = 2 + 0.414214 = 2 + \frac{1}{\cfrac{1}{0.414214}} =
   2 + \frac{1}{2.144211}

This can be inserted into :eq:`game` and we get

.. math::

   1 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2.144211}}

But wait! We can do it again:


.. math::

   1 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2.144211}}}

and again and again ... Well, I have
cheated a bit. I really should have begun the game with the exact
number :math:`\sqrt{2}`. Anyway, it seems that we get an expression

.. math:: 1 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{\cdots}}}}}
	  :label: bigfr

associated with :math:`\sqrt{2}`. What does this mean, really? 

.. note:: 

 .. eqt:: contfrac3

	Try and do the same for :math:`\sqrt{11}` by working with an
	approximate decimal expansion. Which numbers do you encounter?

    A) :eqt:`I` :math:`3, 5, 7`

    #) :eqt:`C` :math:`3, 6`

    #) :eqt:`I` :math:`3, 3, 4`

    #) :eqt:`I` :math:`3, 5, 7, 8`

The algebraic expansion of :math:`\sqrt{2}` into a continued fraction
---------------------------------------------------------------------

We can repeat the above algorithm with the **exact** value of
:math:`\sqrt{2}` using a little algebra:

.. math:: \sqrt{2} = 1 + \sqrt{2} - 1 = 1 + \cfrac{1}{\cfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}-1}} =
   1 + \cfrac{1}{\cfrac{\sqrt{2}+1}{(\sqrt{2}+1)(\sqrt{2}-1)}} = 
   1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \sqrt{2}}
   :label: sq2
	  
Continuing the algorithm outlined in :eq:`algcf` with the number :math:`1 + \sqrt{2}` we get

.. math:: 1 + \sqrt{2} = 2 + \sqrt{2} - 1 = 2 + \cfrac{1}{\cfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}-1}}= 2 + \cfrac{1}{\cfrac{\sqrt{2}+1}{(\sqrt{2}+1)(\sqrt{2}-1)}} = 
   2 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \sqrt{2}}
   :label: sq2c
   
Successively inserting :eq:`sq2c` into :eq:`sq2` you see how the very long fraction in :eq:`bigfr` is obtained.


Making sense of continued fractions
-----------------------------------

Let us have a closer look at the long fraction in :eq:`bigfr`. It
seems natural to truncate our computations of this long fraction by
breaking off after a certain point:

.. math::

   1, \quad 1 + \cfrac{1}{2}, \quad 1 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2}}, \quad
   1 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2}}}, \quad  1 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2}}}}, \dots

corresponding to the fractions

.. math::

   1,\quad \frac{3}{2}, \quad \frac{7}{5}, \quad \frac{17}{12}, \quad \frac{41}{29}, \quad \dots


Expanded decimally these fractions are approximately

.. math::

   1, \quad 1.5, \quad 1.4, \quad 1.4167, \quad 1.4138

Comparing this to :math:`\sqrt{2} \approx 1.4142` it seems that some hidden magic is at play. In fact, if you compute :eq:`bigfr` down to a depth of *ten* you end up with the fraction

.. math::

   \frac{3363}{2378} \approx 1.4142126

very close to :math:`\sqrt{2} \approx 1.4142136`. In a sense, this behavior is not so special for :math:`\sqrt{2}`, but extends
miraculously to all numbers, when they are processed with the algorithm
coming from :eq:`algcf`! We will explain this later. 

Definition of a continued fraction
----------------------------------

I think this is the time to introduce the formal definition: an 
*infinite continued fraction* is an expression of the form

.. math:: a_0 + \cfrac{1}{a_1 + \cfrac{1}{a_2 + \cfrac{1}{a_3 + \cfrac{1}{\dots}}}},
	  :label: defcf
	  
where :math:`a_0` is an integer and :math:`a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots` are
positive natural numbers. A *finite continued fraction* is a
truncation of an infinite continued fraction i.e., we only go down to
a certain depth.

   
Continued fractions for rational numbers
----------------------------------------

A finite continued fraction is an honest fraction! Here you can just compute
bottom up and find the numerator and denominator.
Well, how about a fraction :math:`p/q`?

You may have heard about division with remainder. If we suppose that
:math:`q>0`, then division by :math:`q` with remainder says that 

.. math::

   p = d q + r,

where :math:`0\leq r < q` and :math:`d` is an integer. Therefore

 .. math::

    \frac{p}{q} = \frac{d q + r}{q} = d + \cfrac{r}{q} = d + \cfrac{1}{\cfrac{q}{r}}

showing one step in our usual algorithm for the rational number
:math:`p/q`. Now our algorithm may be applied once more to the 
fraction :math:`q/r`. Will this algorithm terminate?

.. attention::

   Let us have a look at
   the specific example :math:`355/113`. Since
   :math:`355 = 3\cdot 113 + 16`  we get

    .. math:: \frac{355}{113} = \frac{3\cdot 113 + 16}{113} = 3 + \frac{16}{113} = 3 + \cfrac{1}{\cfrac{113}{16}}
       :label: fscf
   
    Again, since :math:`113 = 7\cdot 16 + 1` we get

    .. math:: \frac{113}{16} = \frac{7\cdot 16 + 1}{16} = 7 + \frac{1}{16}
       :label: lscf
		  
    This is all we need! Now insert :eq:`lscf` into :eq:`fscf` to obtain
    the finite continued fraction

    .. math:: \frac{355}{113} = 3 + \cfrac{1}{7 + \cfrac{1}{16}}.


The continued fraction algorithm for rational numbers is the
`Euclidean algorithm <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm>`_ in disguise.
