We will enter into an interesting application of continued fractions: 
the prime factorization of a natural number.


Prime numbers
=============

A `prime number <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number>`_ is a natural number with exactly two divisors. Here is the list of the first few natural numbers with the prime numbers marked red:

$$
1, \\color{red}{2}, \\color{red}{3}, 4, \\color{red}{5}, 6, \\color{red}{7}, 8, 9, 10, \\color{red}{11}, 12, \\color{red}{13}, 14, 15, 16, \\color{red}{17}, 18, \\color{red}{19}, 20, 21, 22, \\color{red}{23}, 24, 25, 26, \\dots
$$

A famous method for generating the prime numbers goes under the name
of `the sieve of Eratosthenes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes>`_. In
fact there is an exceptionally beautiful proof due to Euclid that
there are infinitely many prime numbers.


.. attention::

   
   A fundamental fact is that every natural number $>1$ is divisible by a prime number. You can prove this by induction starting with the first
   few cases: 
   
   $$
   2 = 2\\cdot 1, 3 = 3\\cdot 1, 4 = 2\\cdot 2, 5 = 5\\cdot 1, 6 = 2\\cdot 3.
   $$
   
   Assume by induction that we have proved that every natural number $<N$ is divisible by a prime number, then we must prove that $N$ is
   divisible by a prime number: if $N$ is a prime number, then $N$ is divisible by a prime number i.e., $N = N \\cdot 1$. If not, there
   exists smaller numbers $a, b$, such that $N = a b$. But by induction $a$ is divisible by a prime number $p$, say $a = p c$. Therefore
   $N = p (c b)$ and $N$ is divisible by the prime number $p$.
   
   We will prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers using proof by contradiction i.e., assume that there are
   finitely many prime numbers and list them as
   
   \\begin{equation}
   \\label{primes}
   p_1, p_2, p_3, \\dots, p_n.
   \\end{equation}
   
   Then the natural number
   
   $$
   N = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_n + 1
   $$
   
   is divisible by a prime number. But none of the prime numbers listed in \\eqref{primes} divides $N$ (why?). Therefore there must be a
   prime number missing from the finite list in \\eqref{primes} and there has to be infinitely many prime numbers.



Methods for factoring a number
==============================


Ok, now we have actually proved that every natural number $N$ is a
product of prime numbers, so how do we find these prime numbers? A
straightforward method is to run through the ordered list of prime
numbers from the beginning. If a prime number $p$ divides $N$, then
continue the procedure with $N:=N/p$ from the prime number $p$ and
onwards until it becomes obvious that the current prime number $p$
cannot divide e.g., if $N < p$.

This method is fine for small numbers, but for larger numbers it 
slows down drastically. In fact if you have a $200$ digit number
$N$, which is a product of two $100$ digit prime numbers, the
method above is impossible from a computational standpoint.

You can experiment in Sage with factoring numbers:

.. sage::
   
   F7 = 2^128 + 1
   factor(F7)


In the above experimental box, I have entered code for factoring the
$n$-th `Fermat number <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat_number>`_

$$
F_n = 2^{2^n} + 1
$$

for $n = 7$. These numbers have posed factoring challenges during the last
several decades. Historically, the first factorization of
$F_7$ used continued fractions! This is the $39$-digit number

$$
340282366920938463463374607431768211457.
$$



The old method due to Fermat
----------------------------


Recall the identity

\\begin{equation}
\\label{factor}
(x + y) (x - y) = x^2 - y ^2.
\\end{equation}

If we can find integers $x, y$, such that $N = x^2 - y^2$, then
\\eqref{factor} shows that we have a factorization of $N$. So
if we define

$$
S(x) = x^2 - N,
$$

we could look for a natural number $x$, such that $S(x)$ is a square
number. Usually one runs through

$$
x = \\lfloor \\sqrt{N}\\rfloor + 1, \\lfloor \\sqrt{N}\\rfloor + 2, \\dots
$$



.. note::

   
   What happens when you do this for $N = 2491$ (here $\\lfloor\\sqrt{2491}\\rfloor = 49$)?
   
   An important remark: if $N = u v$, where $u$ and $v$ are odd numbers, then
   
   $$
   N = \\left(\\frac{u+v}{2}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{u-v}{2}\\right)^2. 
   $$
   
   This means that every odd composite number is the difference of two square numbers.





.. attention::

   
   The greatest common divisor of two natural numbers $x, y$ is
   denoted $\\gcd(x, y)$. It is characterized by two
   properties: It is a divisor in both $x$ and $y$ and if 
   $d$ is a common divisor of $x$ and $y$, then 
   $d$ divides $\\gcd(x, y)$. From this definition it follows
   that $\\gcd(x, y) = \\gcd(y, x)$ and that $\\gcd(x, 0) = x$.
   
   A truly fundamental identity is
   
   $$
   \\gcd(x, y) = \\gcd(x - q y, y),
   $$
   
   for $q$ a natural number. This identity is true, because $x$ and $x - q y$ have
   the same common divisors as $x$ and $y$. This obervation leads to
   the euclidean algorithm and the following result: there
   exists integers $\\lambda, \\mu$, such that
   
   $$
   \\lambda x + \\mu y = \\gcd(x, y).
   $$
   
   
   Again you can experiment with Sage in finding the $\\gcd$ along with $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$. This is usually done using the extended euclidean algorithm. Try it out below and figure out exactly what the output means.
   
   .. sage::
      
      xgcd(15, 21)
   
   
   An important consequence is the following very useful result:
   If $a$ divides $b c$ and $\\gcd(a, b) = 1$, then 
   $a$ divides $c$. Here $a, b$ and $c$ are natural numbers.



Enter congruences and the method of Kraitchik
---------------------------------------------


We need a small amount of number theory to proceed. Two natural numbers
$a, b$ are called congruent modulo $N$ if

$$
N \\mid a - b,
$$

i.e., if $N$ divides their difference. This is denoted

$$
a \\equiv b\\pmod N
$$

and the definition goes back to the the masterpiece `Disquisitiones Arithmeticae <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disquisitiones_Arithmeticae>`_ by `Carl Friedrich Gauss <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss>`_.

If instead of aiming for $N = x^2 - y^2$, we aim for $N \\mid x^2 - y^2$ or

\\begin{equation}
\\label{kraitchik}
x^2 \\equiv y^2\\pmod N, 
\\end{equation}

good things will happen. If

$$
N \\mid x^2 - y^2 = (x + y) (x -y),
$$

and $N\\nmid x+y$ and $N\\nmid x - y$, then $d = \\gcd(N, x + y)$ is a
non-trivial factor of $N$ i.e., $1 < d < N$.

Now there is a very clever method due to Kraitchik as how to systematically
find $x$ and $y$ satisfying \\eqref{kraitchik}: if we are
given numbers $x_1, \\dots, x_n$ and

\\begin{align*}
x_1^2&\\equiv a_1\\pmod N\\\\
&\\vdots\\\\
x_n^2 &\\equiv a_n \\pmod N,
\\end{align*}

then

\\begin{equation}
\\label{glue}
x_1^2\\cdots x_n^2 = (x_1\\cdots x_n)^2\\equiv a_1 \\cdots a_n \\pmod N.
\\end{equation}

If $a_1 \\cdots a_n$ happens to be a square number, then this is our $y^2$ and
$x^2$ is $(x_1 \\cdots x_n)^2$.


A concrete example for $\\sqrt{N}$
----------------------------------



Let us consider the function $S(x) = x^2 - N$ for $N = 2041$. Then

$$
x^2 \\equiv S(x) \\pmod N.
$$

For different values of $x$, we tabulate $S(x)$ along with its
prime factorization with a little help from Sage:


.. sage::
   
   N = 2041
   def S(x): return x*x - N
   
   print S(46)
   factor(S(46))


Here is the table:

+-----------+-------------+-----------------------------+
| $x$       | $S(x)$      | Prime factorization         |
+-----------+-------------+-------+-------+-------+-----+
| $46$      | $75$        |       | $3$   | $5^2$ |     |
+-----------+-------------+-------+-------+-------+-----+
| $47$      | $168$       | $2^3$ | $3$   |       | $7$ |
+-----------+-------------+-------+-------+-------+-----+
| $48$      | $263$       |           $263$             |
+-----------+-------------+-------+-------+-------+-----+
| $49$      | $360$       | $2^3$ | $3^2$ | $5$   |     |
+-----------+-------------+-------+-------+-------+-----+
| $50$      | $459$       |       | $3^3$ |     $17$    |
+-----------+-------------+-------+-------+-------+-----+
| $51$      | $560$       | $2^4$ |       | $5$   | $7$ |
+-----------+-------------+-------+-------+-------+-----+

Can we use this table and \\eqref{glue} to find a prime factorization of $N$?


Link to continued fractions
===========================


Last week we saw the inequality

$$
\\left| \\xi - \\frac{p}{q}\\right| < \\frac{1}{q^2},
$$

where $\\xi$ is an irrational number and $p/q$ is a convergent in the
continued fraction expansion for $\\xi$. In other words,

$$
\\frac{p}{q} = \\xi + \\varepsilon,
$$

where $|\\varepsilon| < \\frac{1}{q^2}$. Applying this to $\\xi = \\sqrt{N}$, we get

\\begin{align*}
\\frac{p}{q} &= \\sqrt{N} + \\varepsilon \\implies\\\\
\\\\
\\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right)^2 &= N + 2 \\varepsilon \\sqrt{D} + \\varepsilon^2 \\implies\\\\
\\\\
p^2 &= N q^2 + 2 \\varepsilon \\sqrt{N} q^2 + \\varepsilon^2 q^2\\implies\\\\
\\\\
p^2 - N q^2 &= 2 \\varepsilon \\sqrt{N} q^2 + \\varepsilon^2 q^2\\leq 2 \\sqrt{N} + 1
\\end{align*}



.. attention::

   
   So if $p/q$ is a convergent in the continued fraction expansion for $\\sqrt{N}$, then
   
   \\begin{equation}
   \\label{ineq}
   p^2 - N q^2 < 2 \\sqrt{N} + 1.
   \\end{equation}
   
   An idea proposed in 1931, is to use the numerators and denominators in the continued fraction expansion
   for $\\sqrt{N}$ as input to \\eqref{glue} to try and factor $N$ i.e., if $p_n/q_n$ is the
   $n$-th convergent, then for $x_n := p_n$ and $a_n := p_n^2 - N q_n^2$, we have
   
   $$
   x_n^2 \\equiv a_n \\pmod N
   $$
   
   Because of the inequality in \\eqref{ineq}, $a_n$ becomes smaller than $S(x) = x^2 - N$ and therefore easier to factor into prime numbers.
   However crazy this idea sounds, it was a major breakthrough when the method was used
   to factor the seventh Fermat number by Morrison and Brillhart, September 13, 1970. This is reported in their 1975 paper
   `A Method of Factoring and the Factorization of $F_7$ <http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1975-29-129/S0025-5718-1975-0371800-5/S0025-5718-1975-0371800-5.pdf>`_ (check it out!).


Another important reference for the fascinating topic of prime factorization is Pommerance's paper
`A Tale of two Sieves <http://www.ams.org/notices/199612/pomerance.pdf>`_.

To see how far computers have come, below is a picture of the IBM 360/91 computer, that Brillhart and Morrison used to
factor the seventh Fermat number.
